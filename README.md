In this group project for making the assembler, we have divided the work equally and fairly among our group members.
We have got a set of instructions in assembly which we have to convert into machine code. Thus we are taking input from the text file (defined as f1 globally in the code). Now we have also made a output file known as f2(globally). For getting the machine code of different type of instructions we have made different functions like MoveImmediate, MoveRegister, Addition, Subtraction, etc which are sufficient to handle the machine code outputs for their respective commands.Also we are adjusting the flags after every statement as mentioned in the question and we have 8 registers as given in the questiom. All the errors are being taken care of in the code and we are also taking care of the whitespaces in the input file. Thus we are getting the output based on the ISA given to us. We are also using two seperate for loops so that the program gets to know about all the labes in the assembly code and thus we can handle the errors with ease.
